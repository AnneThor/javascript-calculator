This is a simple app created with **Create React App** that performs basic calculator functionality.

*Note this calculator uses formula logic when calculating user input (as opposed to immediate execution logic).  The principle is to function like a calculator in that the order of operations is observed for the entire input until the user hits the "=" button.*
